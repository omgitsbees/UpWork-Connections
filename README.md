This repository contains a TensorFlow-based pipeline for building, training, optimizing, and deploying a deep learning model for muscle analysis. The project includes dataset loading, preprocessing, augmentation, training a DenseNet121-based model, optimizing it for TensorFlow Lite, performing inference, and generating classification reports.
Features

    Model Architecture: Fine-tunes DenseNet121 for muscle group classification.
    Data Augmentation: Applies transformations to enhance dataset diversity.
    Optimization: Converts the trained model to TensorFlow Lite for faster inference.
    Inference Pipeline: Supports predictions on new images with post-processing for detailed muscle group analysis.
    Reporting: Generates classification reports for performance evaluation.

Installation
Requirements

    Python 3.6+
    TensorFlow 2.0+
    OpenCV
    NumPy
    scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:

pip install tensorflow opencv-python-headless numpy scikit-learn

Usage
1. Dataset Preparation

Organize the dataset into directories. Each directory corresponds to a muscle group. Update the parse_label function to extract labels from filenames based on your dataset structure.

def parse_label(file_name):
    # Define logic to parse label from file name or directory structure
    raise NotImplementedError("Define label parsing logic here.")

2. Training

Run the script with the path to your dataset:

python muscle_analysis.py

The dataset is split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets. Adjust the num_classes variable to match the number of muscle groups.
3. Model Optimization

The trained model is converted to TensorFlow Lite format for optimized inference.
4. Inference

Test the model with a new image:

sample_image_path = "path_to_sample_image.jpg"

Ensure muscle_names corresponds to your dataset labels.
5. Reports

Generate a classification report for validation or test data:

generate_reports(model, test_images, test_labels)

File Structure

    muscle_analysis.py: Main script with functions for dataset preprocessing, model training, optimization, and inference.
    muscle_analysis_model.tflite: Optimized TensorFlow Lite model (generated after training).
