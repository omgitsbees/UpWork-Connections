Requirements

    Python 3.7+
    Libraries:
        opencv-python
        moviepy
        deepfill (or equivalent inpainting method)
        numpy
        multiprocessing

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-processing-tool.git
cd video-processing-tool

Install the dependencies:

bash

pip install opencv-python-headless moviepy deepfill

Verify that the required modules are installed correctly:

bash

    python -c "import cv2, moviepy, deepfill, numpy"

Usage

    Edit the input/output paths: Open the script and modify the input_video and output_video paths to point to your video files:

    python

input_video = 'input_video.mp4'
output_video = 'output_video.mp4'

Run the script: To process a video file, simply run the Python script:

bash

python video_processing.py

Optional Parallel Processing: If you want to speed up processing using multiple CPU cores, enable parallel processing by setting use_parallel_processing to True in the script:

python

    use_parallel_processing = True

    Output: The processed video will be saved as output_video.mp4 (or any file path you specify).

├── input_video.mp4        # Sample input video (replace with your own)
└── output_video.mp4       # Output video after processing (generated)

How it Works

    Loading the Video: The script uses moviepy to load the video file and process each frame.

    Object Detection and Removal:
        A placeholder object detection function identifies areas in the video where unwanted objects (like captions, emojis, or images) are located.
        Inpainting is then applied to remove the detected objects and restore the video. The project uses DeepFill or OpenCV's cv2.inpaint for this task.

    Post-Processing: After object removal, a denoising filter is applied to enhance the overall quality of the video.

    Parallel Processing: The script can use Python’s multiprocessing.Pool to process frames in parallel, drastically reducing the processing time for large videos.
